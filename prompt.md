The following modules are conditionally inserted based on activated toggles:

**[{pick from plain text, json, html, xml, rtf]**
Automatically detect titles, headings, subheadings, paragraphs, bullet lists, footnotes, tables etc... and represent them in {format type}

---
**[Pretty Formatting Enabled]**
Reconstruct the provided text to improve readability. Remove unnecessary line breaks, adjust paragraphing, smooth out odd spacing, and ensure the final output is polished and easy to read.

---

**[Original Formatting Enabled (If this is on, pretty formatting will need to be auto turned off if on)]**
Preserve the source document's layout exactly as it appears. Retain all original line breaks, indentation, spacing, and alignment without any modification.

---

**[Language Detection & Translation Enabled]**
Automatically detect the language of the input text. If a TARGET_LANGUAGE is specified, translate the OCR output into that language; if not specified, maintain the original language.

---

**[Error Correction Enabled]**
Automatically refine the OCR output by correcting common recognition mistakes. Fix typographical errors, improve grammatical structures, and adjust wording based on contextual understanding.

---

**[Low Confidence Highlighting Enabled]**
Identify sections of the text where OCR confidence is low. Mark these segments with a designated marker, “[?]”, to indicate areas requiring review.

---

**[Contextual Grouping Enabled]**
Intelligently merge or group related content elements. For example, combine captions with their corresponding charts or diagrams, ensuring that related text elements are presented together as cohesive blocks.

---

**[Accessibility (Alt Text Extraction) Enabled]**
Detect any images or graphical elements within the document. Automatically generate descriptive alternative text (alt text) for each image to meet accessibility requirements.

---

**[Smart Context (Annotation Parsing & Spatial Clues) Enabled]**
Extract and separate annotations, side notes, or comments from the main text. Include visual clues that describe spatial relationships (e.g., “This caption appears below the image”) to preserve context and layout hints.
